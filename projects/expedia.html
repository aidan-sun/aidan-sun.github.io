            <h2 class="i">Project Statement</h2>
            
            <p>How might we design an experience that encourages Expedia and Vrbo users to make <span class="b">environmentally sustainable traveling and lodging</span> decisions without incorporating the concepts of <span class="b">greenwashing</span>, the practice of misleading users regarding environmental impact by using false or exaggerated claims, and <span class="b">eco-guilt</span>, any guilt/shame a user might feel for not following sustainable practices?</p>

            <div class="padding3"></div>



            <h2 class="i">User Group</h2>
            
            <p><span class="b">Middle-class solo travelers</span> that can afford to live sustainably, but have <span class="b">neutral attitudes towards sustainable policies</span> & movements.</p>

            <div class="padding3"></div>



            <h2 class="i">What Is Sustainability?</h2>
            
            <p>This project was centered around the concept of <span class="b">sustainability</span>,  but what exactly does this mean? Our team defines sustainability as:</p>

            <div class="i quote"><p>"A framework for <span class="b">engaging travelers</span> and <span class="b">the travel industry</span> at large in supporting goals that would help <span class="b">improve the environment</span> and build a <span class="b">healthier planet</span>. This includes, but is not limited to, protecting the environment, addressing climate change, minimizing plastic consumption, and expanding economic development in communities affected by tourism."</p></div>

            <p>
            <!-- We wanted to help users who might already wish to be more sustainable achieve this goal while also pointing users who might be more neutral on the subject of sustainability towards choosing sustainable practices.<br><br> -->

            The biggest hurdles our team faced in regards to promoting sustainable practices was <span class="b">eco-guilt</span>, any guilt/shame a user might feel for not following sustainable practices, and <span class="b">greenwashing</span>, the practice of misleading users regarding environmental impact by using false or exaggerated claims. 
            </p>

            <div class="padding3"></div>

            <h2 class="i">Approach</h2>

            <p>Because sustainability is such a complex problem space, our team divided ourselves into <span class="b">two subprojects</span> for flight (expedia.com) and lodging (vrbo.com) in order to better tackle unique sustainability issues related to each. We utilized an <span class="b">agile</span> approach, implementing two-week sprints for each subproject.</p>

          <h2 class="i ">Final Design Overview</h2>

          <p>For Expedia.com, our team designed the <span class="b">"Hive"</span>, a community for Expedia users who are interested in travelling sustainably. Upon joining, Hive members are presented with <span class="b">more sustainability-oriented options</span> for booking flights. <br><br>As an added incentive to flying sustainably, our team also devised a <span class="b">point system</span>, rewarding the user more depending on what sustainable options they chose for their flight.</p>

          <div class="padding1"></div>


          <h2 class="i ">Final Design Overview</h2>

          <p>With Vrbo.com, we decided to focus on the <span class="b">hosts rather than the guests</span>, as we found more opportunity to introduce sustainable practices when we focused more towards hosts. <br><br>In our design, Vrbo hosts have the option of being an <span class="b">"eco-host"</span>. Eco-hosts would be given <span class="b">increased visibility</span> to guests, <span class="b">deals</span> on sustainable tech, <span class="b">financial support</span> from Vrbo & more under the condition they verifiably follow the required sustainability practices Vrbo lays out. Tackling sustainability from the end of the host will also improve sustainability from the guests.</p>

            <div class="padding4"></div>

          <h3 class="b">APPROACH</h3>
            <p>Our team took a deep dive into researching and understanding eco-guilt. We looked into ways to <span class="b">make sustainable options more attractive</span> for users, and how to motivate users to choose these options long term.</p>

          <div class="padding4"></div>

          <h3 class="b">TAKEAWAYS</h3>

            <p class="indent1">- Striving for perfection instead of progress</p>
              <p class="indent2">- Small, attainable actions will enable users to be sustainable long term</p>

          <h3 class="b">TAKEAWAYS</h3>

          <p class="i">OVERALL FINDINGS</p>
          <p>+ Subtlety is more appealing to users and reduces eco-guilt</p>
          <p>+ Using simple terms creates a better user understanding</p>
          
          <div class="padding4"></div>

          <h2 class="b indent3">Design Evaluation</h2>

          <h3 class="b">Guerilla Testing</h3>
          <p>We conducted guerilla testing (gathering random participants from a public space) on our Mid-Fi designs with 10 participants.</p>
          <div class="padding5"></div>
          <p class="b">TAKEAWAYS:</p>
          <p>+ Merge the mid-fi designs into one coherent system</p>
          <p>+ Provide clearer definitions and context for our design</p>
          <p>+ Prioritize price, as that's what users care most about</p>
          <p>+ People loved the bees in our design!</p>

          <div class="padding4"></div>

          <h3 class="b">Other Testing</h3>

          <div class="padding5"></div>
          <p class="b">TAKEAWAYS:</p>
          <p>+ Users don’t research into an airlines’ sustainability practices</p>
          <p>- The community/Hive concept caused some confusion in users</p>
          <p>- Users felt somewhat apprehensive to join the community due to how frequently they book flights</p>
          <p>+ The priorities of how users interpret flight information is:</p>
            <p class="indent2">+ Price</p>
            <p class="indent2">+ Location</p>
            <p class="indent2">+ Sustainability filters</p>

          <h3 class="b">GOALS</h3>
            <p>+ Evaluate the current onboarding process for Vrbo hosts</p>
            <p>+ Identify areas where sustainability information may be helpful/engaging</p>

            <div class="padding4"></div>

          <h3 class="b">APPROACH</h3>
            <p>Our team mapped out the process of becoming a Vrbo host, inspecting the different pages and how they would be navigated, and how we might insert sustainability into this process.</p>

          <img src="/images/expedia/process/vrboFlowChart.jpg" class="imgProj">

          <div class="padding4"></div>

          <h3 class="b">TAKEAWAYS</h3>

          <p>+ Many of the landing pages can be condensed and offer information on sustainable practices</p>
          <p>+ During the creation of the first flowchart, our focus was on Vrbo guests. Lots of the information present on the site was dependent on being supplied by the homeowner, so we shifted focus onto homeowners and Vrbo partners.</p>
