            <h2 class="i">Project Statement</h2>
            
            <p>How might we design an experience that encourages Expedia and Vrbo users to make <span class="b">environmentally sustainable traveling and lodging</span> decisions without incorporating the concepts of <span class="b">greenwashing</span>, the practice of misleading users regarding environmental impact by using false or exaggerated claims, and <span class="b">eco-guilt</span>, any guilt/shame a user might feel for not following sustainable practices?</p>

            <div class="padding3"></div>



            <h2 class="i">User Group</h2>
            
            <p><span class="b">Middle-class solo travelers</span> that can afford to live sustainably, but have <span class="b">neutral attitudes towards sustainable policies</span> & movements.</p>

            <div class="padding3"></div>



            <h2 class="i">What Is Sustainability?</h2>
            
            <p>This project was centered around the concept of <span class="b">sustainability</span>,  but what exactly does this mean? Our team defines sustainability as:</p>

            <div class="i quote"><p>"A framework for <span class="b">engaging travelers</span> and <span class="b">the travel industry</span> at large in supporting goals that would help <span class="b">improve the environment</span> and build a <span class="b">healthier planet</span>. This includes, but is not limited to, protecting the environment, addressing climate change, minimizing plastic consumption, and expanding economic development in communities affected by tourism."</p></div>

            <p>
            <!-- We wanted to help users who might already wish to be more sustainable achieve this goal while also pointing users who might be more neutral on the subject of sustainability towards choosing sustainable practices.<br><br> -->

            The biggest hurdles our team faced in regards to promoting sustainable practices was <span class="b">eco-guilt</span>, any guilt/shame a user might feel for not following sustainable practices, and <span class="b">greenwashing</span>, the practice of misleading users regarding environmental impact by using false or exaggerated claims.

          <h2 class="i">Final Design Overview</h2>

          <p>For Expedia.com, our team designed the <span class="b">"Hive"</span>, a community for Expedia users who are interested in travelling sustainably. Upon joining, Hive members are presented with <span class="b">more sustainability-oriented options</span> for booking flights. As an added incentive to flying sustainably, our team also devised a <span class="b">point system</span>, rewarding the user more depending on what sustainable options they chose for their flight.</p>

          <div class="padding3"></div>


          <h2 class="i">Final Design Overview</h2>

          <p>With Vrbo.com, we decided to focus on the <span class="b">hosts rather than the guests</span>, as we found more opportunity to introduce sustainable practices when we focused more towards hosts. Now, Vrbo hosts have the option of being an <span class="b">"eco-host"</span>. Eco-hosts would be given <span class="b">increased visibility</span> to guests, <span class="b">deals</span> on sustainable tech, <span class="b">financial support</span> from Vrbo & more under the condition they verifiably follow the required sustainability practices Vrbo lays out. Tackling sustainability from the end of the host will also increase sustainability from the guests.</p>

          <p class="center caption i">Hosts can set guidelines and rules that guests must follow.</p>
