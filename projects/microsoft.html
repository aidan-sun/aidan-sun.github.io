            <h2 class="i">Project Statement</h2>
            
            <p>How might our team improve Microsoft's self-help resources for Millennial and Gen-Z users so that the self-help experience is more interactive, engaging, and easier to use? How do Millennial and Gen-Z users currently interact with Microsoft's self-help platforms, and how can we use this to inform our research?</p>

            <div class="padding3"></div>



            <h2 class="i">User Group</h2>
            
            <p>Our user group for this project focused on Millennials and Gen-Zers who use Microsoft products, especially looking into those with a moderate to low level of tech-literacy.</p>

            <div class="padding3"></div>



            <h2 class="i">Project Goals</h2>

            <p>Our teams goals for this project were to better understand how our user group interacts with Microsoft's self help platforms and resources, and to identify what might make them use these services or stray away from them. Through this extensive research, we would create in-depth design recommendations for Microsoft.</p>

            <div class="padding3"></div>



            <h2 class="i">What Is Self-Help?</h2>
            
            <p>This project centered completely around the concept of self-help, which our group defined as:</p>

            <div class="i quote"><p>"A resource designed to help users solve problems related to certain products, allowing users to troubleshoot any issues independent of direct assistance."</p></div>

            <p>Our team focused primarily at self-help in the form of websites, forums, and other types of online guides.</p>

          <p>A significant 76% of Americans, predominantly from this generation, indicate they would recommend a brand based solely on a positive digital experience.</p>
          <p>The preference for self-service solutions is markedly strong among Gen Z, who favor resolving issues through modern conveniences such as online chat, texting, or social media. This tendency highlights an essential shift towards digital solutions that provide efficient problem resolution without the necessity for direct human interaction. </p>

          <h1 class="center ">Millennials</h1>
          <p>We considered millennials through a broad range of 27 to 45, mostly focusing on those closer to Gen Z age. Though their childhoods weren't as integrated in technology as Gen Z's, this generation is still tech savvy, maturing during the blossoming of the internet and tech boom. </p>
          <p>Millennials tend to have more brand loyalty compared to Gen Z, often sticking to brands they have had positive interactions with in the past or childhood, sticking with brands that they might find flawed for a variety of reasons. </p>
          

          <div class="quote"><p><span class="i b">"I’m loyal to Microsoft because I grew up with it."</span><br>-Millennial Interviewee</p></div>
          <p>Millennials value concrete results and expert interactions, with 47% prioritizing issue resolution and 38% appreciating knowledgeable support. They are particularly sensitive to customer service quality, with bad experiences prompting them to switch brands, underscoring the importance of memorable and positive service encounters.</p>
